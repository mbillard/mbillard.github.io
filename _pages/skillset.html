<p>During my formation at the <a title="Polytechnique de MontrÃ©al" href="http://polymtl.ca" target="_blank">Polytechnique</a>, I've been trained in a huge variety of skills, programming languages and techniques. Here's an incomplete list of what I know and love to do.</p>

<h3>Fields of expertise (and interests)</h3>
<p>My biggest field of expertise is by far Web development. I absolutely love building Web applications and, even though I can not pinpoint the exact time I started creating Web sites, I've been doing that since I was about 14-15 years old  (and since 2004 professionally).</p>

<p>During all those years, I've learned to develop with C#, ASP.NET, ASP, PHP and to use extensively the underlying languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and jQuery).</p>

<p>I've also worked with various tools such as Visual Studio (2005, 2008), Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and Photoshop (even though I am not a graphic designer) to name a few.</p>

<p>Among the skills I developed during my formation and through work experience are Object-Oriented programming, user interface design and database management (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle).</p>

<h3>Others</h3>
<p>Mostly as part of my formation, but sometimes just for curiosity, I worked a bit under Linux (Gentoo, Slackware, Kubuntu, Fedora) and quite a lot in C and C++. I also had the opportunity to use Java as well as doing some more graphical projects which were quite interesting (such as ray-tracing and game development), but not exactly my favorite subjects.</p>

<p>These are just a subset of my skills, but as they are the most interesting to me, they are mostly the only ones relevant.</p>
