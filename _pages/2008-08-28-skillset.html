During my formation at the <a title="Polytechnique de MontrÃ©al" href="http://polymtl.ca" target="_blank">Polytechnique</a>, I've been trained in a huge variety of skills, programming languages and techniques. Here's an incomplete list of what I know and love to do.
<h3>Fields of expertise (and interests)</h3>
My biggest field of expertise is by far Web development. I absolutely love building Web applications and, even though I can not pinpoint the exact time I started creating Web sites, I've been doing that since I was about 14-15 years old  (and since 2004 professionally).

During all those years, I've learned to develop with C#, ASP.NET, ASP, PHP and to use extensively the underlying languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and jQuery).

I've also worked with various tools such as Visual Studio (2005, 2008), Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and Photoshop (even though I am not a graphic designer) to name a few.

Among the skills I developed during my formation and through work experience are Object-Oriented programming, user interface design and database management (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle).
<h3>Others</h3>
Mostly as part of my formation, but sometimes just for curiosity, I worked a bit under Linux (Gentoo, Slackware, Kubuntu, Fedora) and quite a lot in C and C++. I also had the opportunity to use Java as well as doing some more graphical projects which were quite interesting (such as ray-tracing and game development), but not exactly my favorite subjects.

These are just a subset of my skills, but as they are the most interesting to me, they are mostly the only ones relevant.
