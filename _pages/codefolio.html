<p>Here's a sample of my projects, unfortunately I cannot detail or list them all due to the confidential nature of many of them.</p>

<p><strong><a title="A fitness marketplace" href="http://www.coachoasis.com">CoachOasis</a></strong>: A fitness marketplace to help people find the perfect fitness classes for them and help the pros engage with the community while reaching more people.</p>

<p><a title="CSharpSharp project page" href="http://code.google.com/p/csharpsharp/"><strong>CSharpSharp</strong></a>: A collection of classes and extension methods used to streamline common programming tasks.</p>

<p><a title="Survvit" href="http://www.survvit.com"><strong>Survvit</strong></a>: An online survey creator where options are upvoted and downvoted <em>Ã  la</em> reddit. The application is the result of a weekend project where I tried learning Ruby on Rails. See <a title="Post about the creation of Survvit" href="http://www.crossbrowser.net/513/survvit-my-weekend-project/">this blog post</a> for more information about the project.</p>

<p><strong>TemplateEngine</strong>:  We had to work with many templates at work, so I wrote a solid template  engine to help us develop our applications as cleanly and fast as  possible. The engine automates most of the common templating tasks with  an easy to use API.</p>

<p><strong>Financial &amp; Project management systems</strong> for a major Canadian telecommunications company. The systems, primarily used by project managers help them make all their strategic decisions. The solutions have to be competitive against big software companies such as CGI and SAP.</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-170" title="Thumbnail of the application" src="{{ BASE_PATH }}images/pages/codefolio/stonesearch_thumb.png" alt="Screenshot of a screen of StoneSearch" width="214" height="152" />StoneSearch, an online specialized inventory system </strong>for Polycor. StoneSearch brings the power of rich Web applications to provide complex and powerful search capabilities to an inventory of slabs.</p>

<p><strong>Code generation tools</strong> used to reduce the amount of repetitive manual work on a project and let developers focus on the work that produces value.</p>

<p><strong>Localization manager</strong> to help system administrators in their task of making their applications readable by users from different cultures. The application makes use of an innovative domain model to reduce the amount of work needed to localize an application by minimizing the duplication of localized strings. The application is managed via a single web page inside the website being localized itself.</p>

<p><strong>Quantities component </strong>that handles the conversions seamlessly and reduces the mental overload for developers working with measures from multiple units. With the component, the developer can take a measure in inches, multiply it by a measure in centimeters and return an area in square meters without even thinking about conversions. This was a huge time saver in the StoneSearch application.</p>

<p>... and many others such as an <a title="Online database management system" href="http://www.mbillard.com/tag/PFE/" target="_self">online database management system</a>, the maintenance and enhancement of an the Intranet for <a title="Posts about Cyber Generation" href="http://www.mbillard.com/tag/cyber-generation/">Cyber Generation</a>, the porting of many cell phone games for <a title="Posts about Gameloft" href="http://www.mbillard.com/tag/gameloft/">Gameloft</a> and plenty of small school projects and personal applications.</p>
