      <p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</p>

      <p>
        I have over 15 years of experience building great products with a focus
        on good user experience. I have collaborated closely with product
        managers, designers, data analysts, executives, customers, and
        developers to analyse, define, launch, and iterate on dozens and dozens
        of features loved by users.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've used data and customer feedback to inform product decisions. I've
        done numerous A/B tests. I've launched features behind feature flags so
        that we could roll them out at the desired pace. I've done backend,
        frontend, and database development.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm fully bilingual in English and French. I have worked remotely for
        the past 4 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart from product management and web development work, I'm interested
        in personal finance (wrote a few blog posts), board games (started a
        YouTube channel, built an app for a C$ 700k Kickstarter), video games
        (built a web app to leverage the community to brute-force a puzzle in
        Fez), and escape rooms (100% success rate so far).
