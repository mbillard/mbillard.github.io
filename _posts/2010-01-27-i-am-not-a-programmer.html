<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-150" title="Binary Code" src="http://www.mbillard.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/1159615_binary_code_3.jpg" alt="" width="127" height="180" />My job is to program web applications. To accomplish this, I have to do a lot of things: code the back-end, write the markup, tweak the SQL queries, arrange the styling, etc. Programming is a huge part of my work, but the thing is that I don't feel like a programmer. I'm also pretty good at doing all of the above, I'd rate myself a 8 or 9 on 10 (where 10 is a guru) at all the skills I just listed.

The actual act of programming is not the reason why I program, I do it for the results. That probably explains why I prefer to use high level languages that abstract most of the boring parts of programming and let me get from the idea to the implementation as fast as possible.

I don't exactly know what I really am if I'm not a programmer. I really like creating web applications, thinking of new features or new projects that I could do, but I never look forward to actually coding it. I like playing with the markup, the styling and the client-side behavior (the whole front-end), but I hate programming what's under the hood.

Any other programmers out there feeling that they are programming out of necessity instead of passion?
