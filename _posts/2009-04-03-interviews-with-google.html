Back in 2007, when I was about to complete my undergraduate degree in software engineering, I applied for a position at Google. They had just opened an office in Montreal and since I had excellent grades I thought I had a chance.

My friend <a title="Optimizing the World" href="http://simonfl.com" target="_blank">Simon</a> also applied at the same time and we both received emails informing us that we would be going through a few interviews, starting with the phone interview.
<h3>The phone interview</h3>
The interviewer kept asking me about network related stuff and heavy performance oriented problems. After the interview (which didn't go well since I couldn't answer most of the questions because they were all about things I don't like doing), they informed me that I would not be doing more interviews because I was not a good fit for the position they were considering me for. I'm glad I didn't go for that job, I would've hated it though I would have liked to be considered for a position where my skills were useful. I prefer working on the front-end part of applications, creating features and working on improving the usability. I asked them about other positions, but they wouldn't reply to my emails (not because I was harassing them, just because my emails seemed to get lost in my contact's inbox).
<h3>Letting go</h3>
In the end, I found a great opportunity at Oracle (<a title="ORA-01010: Oracle hiring process error" href="http://www.mbillard.com/39/ora-01010-oracle-hiring-process-error/" target="_self">what seemed like a great opportunity</a>) and decided to focus on that instead. Since that didn't work out I finally landed a great job at Hint Innovation.

I'm glad I failed that interview: at the time, Google seemed like the ultimate workplace, but I would have missed on something even better.
