I finally decided to put the time to set-up <a title="Purpose and Scope" href="http://www.mbillard.com/5/purpose-and-scope/" target="_self">the professional blog I've talked about</a> in a previous post.

It's name is <a title="Crossbrowser, software engineering and Web development" href="http://crossbrowser.net" target="_blank">Crossbrowser</a>, because it's a topic that's always important when developing Web applications.

Whenever I post on that blog and feel the subject is also relevant to this blog I'll write a little post to point readers to it.
<h3>What's the difference with this blog?</h3>
I would categorize this blog as a career blog which is a place where I talk about what's going on with my career. The <a title="Crossbrowser, software engineering and Web development" href="http://crossbrowser.net" target="_blank">Crossbrowser</a> blog will mostly talk about the technical aspects of my job or other projects. Most people will find more value in that other blog. However, as I said, whenever a post is relevant to my career blog, I'll write about it.
<h3>Learn revision control, it's good for you</h3>
It's the title of the first such relevant post, I talk about revision control and the lack of teaching of this skill at school and why it should be taught. So <a title="Learn revision control, it's good for you" href="http://crossbrowser.net/42/learn-revision-control-its-good-for-you/" target="_blank">learn revision control, it's good for you</a>.
