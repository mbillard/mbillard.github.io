<h3>What is this about?<strong>
</strong></h3>
Essentially, this blog is about me and my professional life as a Web developer. I'll keep this up-to-date as much as possible to reflect what's going on with my career. This is mostly for my personal use to keep a diary of my work and for a place to talk about my projects. I will try to keep an updated portfolio of my projects in here.
<h3>What is this not about?</h3>
This will not be a technical blog or about programming techniques or anything directly related to my trade. I'm actually currently setting up another blog which will be focused on the Software Engineering profession. I will find a way to notify anyone reading this blog whenever a new post is published on that other blog.
<h3>Why?</h3>
Because, as a recent software engineer graduate, I think it is important to have a place online that you can refer people to in case they want to know what exactly you are doing. This is especially true when you are looking for a job (which I am not), but it also helps to keep a log of what's going on with your life and how you are progressing in your profession.
<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
Mostly for me and people who are interested in my career (not that many people).

Enjoy!
