I have just released a new project of mine called CSharpSharp. It's a collection of classes and extension methods that aim to improve the code usability of the C# language.
<blockquote>Ever since C# 3.0 was released, Iâ€™ve been thinking about the  possibilities opened by the extension methods. Extension methods allow  developers to extend existing classes by providing them with additional  methods. The beauty of this is that we can now create beautiful code  APIs on existing classes without compromising its internal design.</blockquote>
You can learn more about the project by reading <a title="CSharpSharp introduction post" href="http://www.crossbrowser.net/504/introducing-csharpsharp/">my post over at crossbrowser</a> or by heading to <a title="CSharpSharp project homepage" href="http://code.google.com/p/csharpsharp/">its homepage hosted on Google Code</a>.
