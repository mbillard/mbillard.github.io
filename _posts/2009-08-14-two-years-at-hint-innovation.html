Well, it seems I have been working at <a title="My company's Web site" href="http://www.hintinnovation.com" target="_blank">Hint Innovation</a> for 2 years now (as of August 13). I'm happy that I can say that I still love my job. In my previous work experiences I usually got bored after a few weeks, good thing they were just internships. I guess having more responsibilities and real challenges makes my brain happy.
<h3>Retrospective</h3>
I've learned a lot in my two years and I now know myself a lot more (work-wise). I've seen a few employees come and go (though I'm still the youngest...) and worked on plenty of interesting projects. I'm still keeping up with the latest advancements and I feel like I have the skills to improve my field. I'm feeling more confident with my writing skills on my blogs which I'm glad I started doing regularly.

The company also improved a lot, moving from a 10 feet by 10 feet room to a huge 1000+ square feet office. We also improved our processes and we can now produce code much faster than we used to. We learned from our mistakes and we have great things planned for the future.
<h3>Future</h3>
First of all, I plan to stay at Hint, mostly because we have a great team and we have what it takes to make a difference in our field. In the last two years, we fixed a lot of issues in the way we handled clients and we can now use this experience to go ahead and create better applications than ever before. I now have decent experience in my field and I (and my bosses) feel that I now have what is needed to start managing/leading people. This is not entirely new to me since I've helped the various employees that started working at Hint, but I think I could handle a small team. That's why, as more employees start working for us, I would love to take the role of a team lead.

On the personal side, I will keep blogging (mostly at <a title="My programming blog" href="http://crossbrowser.net" target="_blank">crossbrowser.net</a>) and I will do my best to start one of my many projects that are currently just ideas.
