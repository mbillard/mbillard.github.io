<p>It has now been a week since I left Hint Innovation and I've been thinking about what I accomplished there. As to not forget, I decided to write it down here.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I was their first employee</li>
	<li>I initiated the move from CVS to Subversion (SVN)</li>
	<li>I initiated the move from SVN to Mercurial (Hg) (3 years later)</li>
	<li>I started the internal Wiki</li>
	<li>I helped integrate one intern and 3 full-time employees</li>
	<li>I worked on many internal libraries and tools still in use at the time of my departure</li>
	<li>I took a major role in the development of a dozen client projects often as the only front-end developer (while still working on the back-end and storage parts)</li>
	<li>I took part in countless design and architectural meetings and decisions</li>
	<li>I presented a project to a client's client</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I'm happy with what I accomplished at Hint, I feel like I had a huge impact on how the company turned out. Hopefully, I can have the same impact at my new workplace.</p>
