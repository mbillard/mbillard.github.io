On living on your blogging income? Well, this guy did it in just 279 days. He even wrote an excellent ebook (he calls it a manifesto) <a title="Link to the page to learn more about the manifesto and download it" href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/overnight-success/"><em>"279 Days to Overnight Success"</em></a> to tell people interested in doing the same how he did it.</p>

<p>I find the manifesto really interesting because that's something I would like to do myself, at least partially. I love writing, teaching people new things, sharing my experiences. I say partially because I wouldn't have anything to write about if it were not for my work, where I get to learn so much. I have so many project ideas, but I don't take the time to even start any of those. After having read the manifesto, I'm a little more motivated, I need to answer 2 important questions raised in the ebook (he calls them <em>"the two most important questions in the universe"</em>):</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>What do you really want to get out of life?</strong></li>
	<li><strong>What can you offer the world that no one else can?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, if you ever thought about going solo and working on your own, give this ebook a chance and read it.</p>
