I already mentioned that I participate as a cyber-mentor at <a title="Academos - Cybermentorat" href="https://academos.intraflex.ca/intr/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fintr" target="_blank">Academos</a>, a site where student get the chance to talk with professionals from all domains to ask them what the work is like, how to get there and what to expect once you become a professional. If you are a high school teacher (in Quebec, Canada), I strongly suggest that you take a look at the site and see what it can offer for your students.

Next week, I'm taking it to another level. A high school student will be following me for a day (not much following to do since I work on the computer all day). This will not impact my work too much and I will be able to help someone experience first hand what his potential future career will look like, about 6 years before being able to get there.

Helping the future software engineers is something we, at Hint Innovation, and I truly believe in. We depend on what the education system builds, in terms of graduates, and as employers of future graduates, I think it's important to be a part of that system.

Web development education is at a critical point, it's mostly untouched by software engineering formations but most companies now need professional Web developers. There are places other than universities that teach Web development, but they don't teach the same things as the universities. Both are needed, but currently only one exists.
