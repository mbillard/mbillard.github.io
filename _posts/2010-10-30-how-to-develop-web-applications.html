I've written a piece about <a title="How to develop web applications" href="http://www.crossbrowser.net/436/how-to-develop-web-applications/">how to develop web applications</a> over at other blog. Here's an excerpt:
<blockquote>[...] Now that we know what we have to build, we have to build it. This is a  huge step and will most likely be where you spend most of your time. The  first decision you have to take is how you are going to build it, what  technology are you going to use with which framework. There are so many  ways you can do it, you just have to pick one that suits you well. [...] The important thing to know is that <strong>you can build a working web app with any of those</strong>.</blockquote>
Web application development education is a subject that really interests me because I find it rather strange that a domain that is growing so fast is mostly run by people who learned their trade on their own. Sure, computer science and software engineering classes do help, but there's a lot of ground specific to web development that they do not cover.

I think this is a topic that I will be coming back to quite regularly.

Enough now, <a title="Link to my post about how to develop web applications" href="http://www.crossbrowser.net/436/how-to-develop-web-applications/">go read my post</a>.
