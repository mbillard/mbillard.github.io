As you may know, I have started blogging a bit more regularly over at <a title="Web engineering and software development" href="http://crossbrowser.net" target="_blank">Crossbrowser.net</a>. I'm still in my early attemps at blogging and the quality of the text probably shows that. I'm still happy so far of what I've written, hopefully a few more people will start following and commenting. My goal for this year is to write at least one entry per week, I already have content for a dozen posts, but I need to learn to take more time to write.

Here are a few interesting posts (in my opinion) you might've missed:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Code Usability" href="http://crossbrowser.net/97/code-usability/" target="_blank">Code Usability</a></li>
	<li><a title="Process Usability" href="http://crossbrowser.net/99/process-usability/" target="_blank">Process Usability</a></li>
	<li><a title="Password Management 101" href="http://crossbrowser.net/121/password-management-101/" target="_blank">Password Management 101</a></li>
	<li><a title="Handling Users" href="http://crossbrowser.net/137/handling-users/" target="_blank">Handling Users</a></li>
</ul>
In the past few weeks I improved the navigation and layout. I also made some improvements to help with SEO (Search engine optimization) (on this website too). If the traffic gets good enough, I'll probably try to put up some advertisements (non obtrusive of course). In the meantime, I'll keep posting to improve my writing.
