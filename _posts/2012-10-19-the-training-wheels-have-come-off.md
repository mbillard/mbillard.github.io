For the past year, up until July 2012, I have been learning Ruby on Rails at Code GÃ©nome. They were nice enough to trust that I would manage to get up and running with Ruby on Rails even with very little experience with the framework (I had done a tiny project, <a title="Surveys, reddit-style" href="http://www.survvit.com">Survvit</a>, just to see if I could get something running all by myself). During the year, I learned a lot about Rails and the vast differences between it and .Net. I switched from working on a Windows PC in a powerful IDE, to a MAC with Sublime Text (not an IDE, but still a powerful text-editor). I reunited with Unix after not having used it for quite a while. It's a much better work environment than .Net ever was.

Come July 2012, I get contacted by two young entrepreneurs in search for a technical co-founder. At first I was a little skeptical, we've all heard of the stories of business people asking developers for the moon with very little incentive for the developer (it's the next Facebook!). However, these two were different and had done their homework: they had a solid business plan, a project well defined and already quite advanced in terms of design and user experience. They also offered a satisfying compensation for my services as well as the opportunity to be one of the co-founders.

With a little less than a year of experience with Rails, I had my doubts at the beginning, especially since I had a good stable job. Was I ready to fly solo and have no safety net? I was already mostly autonomous, but it's always reassuring to know that help is just a murmur away. Plus, I don't really enjoy sysadmin stuff and that's something that would have to be taken care of, no one else would be able to.

So I took the jump and am I glad I did. Developing a SAAS project is something I've always dreamed about and I'm quite happy with the amount of work I've managed to do up until now. Most of the sysadmin stuff is hidden to me because I decided to go with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">heroku</a>, I managed to implement all the complicated stuff that scared me initially and I'm really enjoying programming again. Working for yourself is so different than doing stuff for a client.

So the development of <a title="Fitness marketplace for trainers and those who want to get fit" href="http://www.coachoasis.com">CoachOasis</a> is going well, we're nearing the date for a private beta and we're really excited to have people start using it and getting healthier with the tool we're making for them.
