Over at my other blog, I talk about <a title="Why you should get your own domain now" href="http://crossbrowser.net/89/why-you-should-get-your-own-domain-now/" target="_self">the importance of owning a domain</a> even if you don't plan on having a website.

Here's a quote from the post:
<blockquote>The most important use you can make with your own domain is having access to an infinity of email addresses. You probably already have at least one @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, @hotmail.com, @whatever-free-email-service.com address, probably 2 or more, everyone does. However, none of these gives you as much freedom as having your own domain does.</blockquote>
