During the final year of the software engineering degree at the <a title="Polytechnique de MontrÃ©al" href="http://www.polymtl.ca/" target="_blank">Polytechnique</a>, students have to undertake a major project which counts for one or two classes (3 to 6 credits). That project can be done alone, with someone else or in a small team. By choosing to work with a small team, you'll get a good real-work experience by working closely with a company to do one of their research-and-development projects. If you do it alone or with a friend, you get to do any project you want, as long as your supervisor approves it.

I had an idea for a project that would allow me to learn quite a few things, so I decided to do the project alone (there was not enough in it for more than one person).
<h3>The project</h3>
<h4>Description and Goals</h4>
I decided to build a Web application to improve my Web development skills. Mostly, I wanted to learn how to use Ajax and to use the object-oriented design philosophy in a Web development project. I was also using <a title="phpMyAdmin" href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php" target="_blank">phpMyAdmin</a> regularly for my projects at the time and I always felt it had too many features and options. I was only using a tiny portion of the tool and felt a simplified tool could be useful for users like me who didn't need everything. I also wanted to add some "on-the-spot" editing of the values in the tables as is possible with desktop applications like <a title="SQL Server Management Studio Express" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C243A5AE-4BD1-4E3D-94B8-5A0F62BF7796&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">SQL Server Management Studio</a>.

So I started working on my Ajax-powered online database management system (DBMS).
<h4>Requirements and Specifications</h4>
The first step was to determine what were the requirements (which I was fixing myself) and which tools at my disposal would help me fulfill those requirements.

The requirements were:
<ul>
	<li>Object-oriented design</li>
	<li>Ajax (no postbacks)</li>
	<li>User-friendly</li>
</ul>
And the tools were:
<ul>
	<li>PHP 5+ for its OO support</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>CSS for the styling</li>
	<li><a title="xampp for windows" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html" target="_blank">XAMPP Lite</a> for testing</li>
</ul>
<h4>Features</h4>
I then determined what features I would put in my first iteration of the application. My goal was not to have a full-featured product ready by the time the project ended, it was more of a proof-of-concept to show that it was feasible to create a simple online DBMS.

Here's a list of the features that made the cut for the first iteration:
<ul>
	<li>Creation and deletion of databases</li>
	<li>Creation, modification and deletion of tables within a database
<ul>
	<li>Addition, modification and deletion of fields for the table (field name, type, default value, auto increment, ...)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Insertion, edition and deletion of rows in the tables</li>
	<li>Query editor to execute written queries on the data</li>
	<li>User-friendly navigation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
I will leave the details of the implementation for a future post, but I managed to implement most of the features while respecting my requirements and specifications. The only missing feature from the list above was the table modification feature.
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
To me, this project was a tremendous success, I managed to do almost everything I had planned and at the end I had a mostly usable online DBMS. It had a few bugs and was missing some critical features, but I learned so much from it. It also helped me get my current job at Hint Innovation since the development philosophy I used for this project was really similar to the way we work at Hint.

Indeed, the way I designed my classes and objects was very similar to the way <a title="Domain-driven design" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" target="_blank">Domain-driven design</a> (DDD) approaches design. At Hint Innovation, we embrace the DDD philosophy and I only have good words for it. While doing my undergraduate thesis I didn't know that my approach to OO design was so different, but since I've started working at Hint, I've seen the similarities between my approach and the Domain-driven design philosophy.
